# Hot Code Reload

To ease development against a running Swoole HTTP server, hot code reloading can be enabled.

With this feature enabled, a Swoole worker will monitor included PHP files using `inotify`, and will restart all workers if a file is changed, thus mitigating the need to manually restart the server to test changes.

**This feature should only be used in your local development environment, and should not be used in production!**

## Requirements

- `ext-inotify`

This library ships with an [inotify](http://php.net/manual/en/book.inotify.php) based implementation of `Mezzio\Swoole\HotCodeReload\FileWatcherInterface`.
In order to use it, the `inotify` extension must be loaded.

## Configuration

The following demonstrates all currently available configuration options:

```php
// config/autoload/swoole.local.php

use Mezzio\Swoole\Event\HotCodeReloaderWorkerStartListener;
use Mezzio\Swoole\Event\WorkerStartEvent;

return [
    'mezzio-swoole' => [
        'hot-code-reload' => [
            // Time in milliseconds between checks to changes in files.
            'interval' => 500,
            'paths'    => [
                // List of paths, either files or directories, to scan for changes.
                // By default this is empty; you will need to configure it.
                // A common value:
                getcwd(),
            ],
        ],
        'swoole-http-server' => [
            'listeners' => [
                // Register the hot code reloader listener with the WorkerStartEvent
                WorkerStartEvent::class => [
                    HotCodeReloaderWorkerStartListener::class,
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ],
];
```

## Logging

When a file is reloaded, a *notice* line will be logged with the message
`Reloading due to file change: {path}`.

The logger used to log these lines is the same used for access logging, which
is described in the [logging section](logging.md#container-usage) of this documentation.

## Limitations

Only files included by PHP after `onWorkerStart` will be reloaded. This means
that Swoole will not reload any of the following:

- New routes
- New pipeline middleware
- The `Application` instance, _or any delegators used to modify it_.
- The Swoole HTTP server itself.

This limitation exists because the hot code reload features use the
`Swoole\Server::reload()` method to notify Swoole to reload
PHP files (see [the Swoole reload() documentation for more details](https://www.swoole.co.uk/docs/modules/swoole-server-methods#public-boolean-swoole-server-reload-void)).
